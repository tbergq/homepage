title: Flow vs Typescript
---

I think this is a question that many people will ask. Why should I choose the one over the other. Both libraries are trying to solve the same problems. 

The general question would probably be is one better than the other. I think the answer is no. Flow solves some problems that typescript does not and vice versa. 

Some people transitioning from flow to typescript seems to be happy, while others does not. 

You should choose the one you think is best for your use case. One thing that does point in favor of typescript is that it seems to get more traction in the community. That being said, my personal preference is Flow.
