## Developer
 I am a JavaScript developer, currently working for <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://kiwi.com">Kiwi.com</a>. I have experience with the following technologies __React__, __React Native__, __GraphQL__, __Relay__, __Flow__, __NodeJS__ and more. I did some __.NET__, __Angular__ and __jQuery__ in the past, but this is not something I am considering going back to.

 I am very happy working with React and GraphQL, and I consider this to be the most interesting tech stack at the moment. I do enjoy learning new technologies, so this might change in the future ðŸ™‚. Though I have most experience on the front end I have always done some job on the back end as well, and I consider my self a fullstack developer.

 I am looking for new opportunities at the moment, so if you think you have something that can interest me, feel free to reach out to me on LinkedIn.

 ## Location(s)

 I am born and raised in Norway :flag-no: , but currently I live in sunny Barcelona with my wife and dog. I have also lived and worked in Lima, Peru :flag-pe: before. Peru is an amazing country with <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.livinginperu.com/peru-wins-again-best-culinary-destination-in-the-world-title-for-8th-consecutive-year/">the best food in the world!</a>


## Interests

<Image src={useBaseUrl('img/handball.jpg')} alt="Trond playing handball" style={{maxHeight: '200px'}}/> 

I used to be an active athlete when I was younger. I played football until I was 15 and I played handball at the top level in Norway. I also have 33 games for the youth national team. I was also working as a coach until I moved to Peru in 2014. 

I am no longer playing any sports actively, but I still enjoy going to the gym or work out in other ways ðŸ™‚

For more relaxing activities I enjoy watching tv series and movies. Some of my favorites shows includes: 

- Game Of Thrones
- Breaking Bad
- Dexter

But there are som many more good ones!

I do believe that my background in teams sports have had a positive effect on my professional career as well. I have learned how to work with others in teams, and I know hard work pays off, both as a developer and as an athlete. 



## What about the rest of this page?

The rest of this page will be used as a personal readme. This means things I want to remember, and I hope that it might come in handy for other developers as well. Feel free to give me feedback if you have any comments.
